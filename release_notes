# Version 1.3.0
  Added a utility for GMs who prefer to keep their NPCs under wraps (that is, with the players denied even Limited permissions)
  Click on the new binoculars item in the Tokens tool bar to the left of the screen and you can select a character or token to display, player(s) to show it to, and which parts of the character you want to display.
  Please note that this is a snapshot of the character at that time and the tracks and other data won't be updated. If the player closes this window you'll have to share it with them again using the SHow Character tool for them to get another look.

# Version 1.2.11
  Bug fix: Creating a track, aspect, or skill in the system menu options with a trailing space in the name caused the item to be uneditable.
  This has now been rectified.

# Version 1.2.10
  Bug fix: Consequences written on characters in FateUtilities weren't being stored properly. This has now been corrected.

# Version 1.2.9
  1. Stunt bonus is now a number rather than a boolean for +2/no +2. This allows for stunts costing multiple refresh that give a bonus of +4, or more broad stunts that give +1, etc. Any character with a +2 stunt will have this converted to a bonus of 2 when their character sheet is opened for the first time following this update.
  2. A modified roll dialog is now available. To use it, shift-click on a skill name on the character sheet, or shift click on the dice button in Fate Utilities after selecting a skill. The modified roll dialog lets you apply a specified bonus (for example, from full defence or teamwork), one or more stunts relevant to the chosen skill, or a second skill to be added to the roll. This last feature allows ModularFate to support two-column skill implementations of Fate Core with somewhat automated rolling. Standard rolls are still available by clicking on a skill or the dice icon on a stunt.

# Version 1.2.8
Very minor update:
  1. Added track and actor name to the track notes dialog.
  2. Changed theming of track notes to be the same as other user interfaces.
