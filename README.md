And unzip it into the `systems` directory of your Foundry `Data` directory. 

### Other Useful Modules

You may also check my modules which complement this system:

1. **Popcorn initiative**
It implements the system of "[elective initiative](https://fate-srd.com/odds-ends/elective-action-order)" that is system agnostic, but is interesting for Fate games.It is part of the "official modules list" so you only need to look up for it in the list of you foundry installation.


1. **Scene notes**
This Module is not part of the official list of modules, but you can download is directly here:<br>
https://github.com/Sk1mble/SceneNotes/archive/master.zip<br>
It permits to add notes directly into a scene and may be used for Scene aspects in Fate.
